   AURAMIND — SITE LOGIC
   One file, no build step, no dependencies. Works on every page
   (index.html, pricing.html, 404.html) and from file:// too.

   - EN / TR / AR translations (+ Arabic RTL)
   - Language detection, ?lang= override, localStorage persistence
   - Mobile navigation, scroll-aware navbar, active-section link
   - Scroll-reveal that never hides content if something fails
   - Offscreen animation / video pausing (battery + CPU)
   - Lead form → WhatsApp handoff
   - Pricing page: plan buttons open WhatsApp in the right language
